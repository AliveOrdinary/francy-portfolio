  ## The Challenge


  Crums is a startup bringing the flavours of South Indian snacks to a new generation. With 14 different snack variations, traditional packaging options were prohibitively expensive for a new business. The challenge was to create a cost-effective packaging solution while maintaining a vibrant, distinctive brand identity.


  ## The Solution


  We developed a unified packaging system using standardized green bags with a yellow label area. Each product variation is distinguished through unique label designs, stickers, and color-coded elements that allow for cost-efficient production while creating a strong brand presence. The playful typography and vibrant color palette establish a contemporary aesthetic that appeals to a younger audience while honoring traditional flavors.
